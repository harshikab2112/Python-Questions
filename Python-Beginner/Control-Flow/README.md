# Python Control Flow Exercises

This repository contains **50 control flow exercises** in Python, designed to help you practice and master **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and **loops** (`for`, `while`). The exercises are categorized into three levelsâ€”**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**â€”to guide you through progressively more complex topics.

## Beginner Level (1â€“15): Conditional Statements and Basic Loops

### Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.  
2. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.  
3. Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 3.  
4. Write a program that checks if a given character is a vowel or consonant.  
5. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers.  
6. Write a program that takes two numbers and checks which is greater.  
7. Check if a given number is between 10 and 20 using conditional statements.  
8. Write a program that accepts a number and checks if it's a multiple of both 5 and 7.  
9. Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 2 or 3.  
10. Write a program that accepts a grade and prints "Pass" if itâ€™s greater than 50, otherwise "Fail".  
11. Write a program to check if a number is a perfect square.  
12. Write a program to check if a number is prime.  
13. Accept a number and check if it's greater than 100 using `if`, `elif`, `else`.  
14. Write a program to print "Yes" if a number is positive, otherwise print "No".  
15. Write a program that prints "Weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday, otherwise "Weekday".

## Intermediate Level (16â€“35): Loops and Nested Conditionals

### Loops (`for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`)

16. Write a program to print the first 10 numbers using a `for` loop.  
17. Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop.  
18. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.  
19. Write a program that prints the factorial of a number using a `for` loop.  
20. Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using a `while` loop.  
21. Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N using a `for` loop.  
22. Write a program that finds all multiples of 3 up to 30 using a `while` loop.  
23. Write a program that asks for user input and prints it until the user types "stop".  
24. Write a program to find the average of numbers from 1 to N using a loop.  
25. Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number using a `for` loop.  
26. Write a program to print the first 10 odd numbers using a `for` loop.  
27. Write a program that prints the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50.  
28. Write a program to find the largest number in a list using a `for` loop.  
29. Write a program that uses `continue` to skip even numbers in a loop and print only odd numbers.  
30. Write a program to print a message "Done!" when a loop finishes.

### Nested Conditional Statements

31. Write a program to print the grade based on marks: A (>= 90), B (>= 70), C (>= 50), D (below 50).  
32. Write a program to check whether a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using `if` and `elif`.  
33. Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18). If eligible, print "Eligible", else print "Not eligible".  
34. Write a program to find whether a year is a leap year or not using nested `if` statements.  
35. Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid based on the lengths of three sides.

### Advanced Loops and Conditional Statements

36. Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using a `for` loop.  
37. Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the Fibonacci series up to that number using a loop.  
38. Write a program that prints all the factors of a given number.  
39. Write a program to print a pattern of stars (`*`) in a triangle shape.  
40. Write a program to print a multiplication table using a `while` loop for the numbers 1 through 10.  
41. Write a program that accepts multiple numbers from the user and breaks the loop when a number less than 0 is entered.  
42. Write a program to print a pyramid pattern of numbers using nested loops.  
43. Write a program that finds all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 1000.  
44. Write a program that accepts a list of numbers and prints the sum of even numbers and the sum of odd numbers separately.  
45. Write a program to check if a number is a palindrome using loops.  
46. Write a program to generate a random number between 1 and 100 until the user guesses the number.  
47. Write a program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string using loops.  
48. Write a program that prints a multiplication table of a given number up to 12 using nested loops.  
49. Write a program that reverses the digits of a number using a `while` loop.  
50. Write a program to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers using loops.
