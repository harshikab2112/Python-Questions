# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice Exercises

This repository contains **50 exercises** focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. The questions are organized into three levelsâ€”**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**â€”covering a wide range of OOP topics such as **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**.

## Beginner Level (1â€“15): Classes, Objects, Basic Concepts

### Classes and Objects

1. Write a simple Python class called `Dog` with a `name` and `age` attribute.  
2. Create an object of the `Dog` class and print its attributes.  
3. Define a `Car` class with attributes like `model`, `year`, and `color`.  
4. Write a class `Rectangle` that has methods to calculate the area and perimeter.  
5. Write a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `introduce` to print the person's details.  
6. Define a class `Circle` with a method to calculate the circumference given the radius.  
7. Create an object of the `Circle` class and print its area using the object.  
8. Write a class `Book` that has a method to print the title and author.  
9. Write a class `BankAccount` with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.  
10. Create an instance of `BankAccount` and test the deposit and withdraw methods.  
11. Define a class `Student` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `grade`, and a method to display the student information.  
12. Write a class `Employee` with `name`, `designation`, and `salary` attributes. Add a method to calculate the annual salary.  
13. Define a class `Square` with a method to calculate its area given the side length.  
14. Write a class `Person` with a `greet` method that prints a greeting message.  
15. Write a class `Temperature` with methods to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

## Intermediate Level (16â€“35): Constructors, Methods, and Inheritance

### Constructors and Methods

16. Write a class `Car` with an `__init__` constructor to initialize its attributes.  
17. Write a class `Book` with an `__init__` constructor and a method to display the book details.  
18. Write a class `Rectangle` with methods for area and perimeter, and an `__init__` constructor.  
19. Define a `Person` class with a constructor that initializes `name` and `age`, and a method to display these details.  
20. Write a class `Account` with an `__init__` constructor to initialize `balance`, `account_number`, and a method to deposit.  
21. Write a class `Shape` with a method to calculate the area, and then extend it to create a `Circle` class.  
22. Create a `Book` class with a method that accepts an argument to update the title.  
23. Write a `Product` class with an `__init__` method that accepts `product_name`, `price`, and `quantity`.  
24. Define a class `Person` with an `__init__` constructor to initialize `name`, `age`, and a method to update the `age`.  
25. Write a class `Animal` with a method `speak`. Create subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat`, overriding the `speak` method for each.

### Inheritance

26. Create a class `Animal` with a `make_sound` method. Then create a class `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and overrides `make_sound`.  
27. Write a class `Vehicle` with a `start` method, and create a subclass `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle`.  
28. Define a class `Person` with a method `introduce`, and create a subclass `Employee` that adds a `position` attribute.  
29. Write a class `Shape` with a method to calculate area, then inherit it in a class `Square` and override the area method.  
30. Define a `Bird` class that inherits from an `Animal` class and adds a method `fly`.  
31. Create a class `Teacher` that inherits from the `Person` class, adding a method `teach`.  
32. Write a class `Parent` with a method `parent_method` and a subclass `Child` that inherits the method.  
33. Create a `Person` class with an `age` method, then create a `Student` class that overrides `age` with its own method.  
34. Write a class `Employee` that inherits from `Person` and overrides the `introduce` method to add job details.  
35. Create a `Shape` class with methods to calculate area and perimeter, then create a subclass `Circle` that overrides the area method.

## Advanced Level (36â€“50): Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction

### Polymorphism

36. Create a `Shape` class with a method `draw`. Create subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`, all overriding the `draw` method.  
37. Write a `Vehicle` class with a `start` method and subclasses `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Bicycle`, all implementing the `start` method differently.  
38. Create a `Animal` class with a method `sound`, and create subclasses `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow`, all implementing the `sound` method.  
39. Define a `Media` class with a `play` method. Create subclasses `Video` and `Audio` that override the `play` method.  
40. Write a `Shape` class with a method `area` and create subclasses `Square`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`, all overriding the `area` method.  
41. Write a class `Employee` with a method `work`, then create subclasses `Manager` and `Developer`, both overriding `work` with their own implementations.  
42. Define a class `Person` with a method `greet`, and create subclasses `Teacher` and `Student` that each have their own version of `greet`.  
43. Write a `Vehicle` class with a method `fuel_efficiency` and subclass `Car` and `Truck` to override it.  
44. Create a `Shape` class with an `area` method, and create subclasses that implement different formulas for area calculation.  
45. Define an interface `Playable` with a method `play`, and create classes `Game` and `Movie` that implement the interface.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction

46. Write a class `BankAccount` with private attributes for `balance`. Add methods to deposit, withdraw, and view the balance, ensuring the balance is protected.  
47. Define a class `Employee` with private attributes for `salary` and a method to access it.  
48. Write a class `Car` that encapsulates the car details (brand, model) and allows access through getter and setter methods.  
49. Define a class `Person` with an `__init__` constructor and a method to get and set private attributes like `name` and `age`.  
50. Write an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `area` and implement the `area` method in subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
