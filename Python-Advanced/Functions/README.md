# Python Functions Practice Exercises

This repository contains **50 exercises** that focus on **functions** in Python, ranging from basic function definitions to advanced topics like **recursion**, **variable arguments**, and **default arguments**. The questions are divided into three levelsâ€”**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**â€”to guide you through the process of learning and mastering functions in Python.

## Beginner Level (1â€“15): Defining and Calling Functions, Basic Arguments

### Defining and Calling Functions

1. Write a function that prints "Hello, World!".  
2. Write a function that takes no arguments and prints your name.  
3. Write a function to take two numbers as arguments and print their sum.  
4. Define a function that accepts a number and prints whether it is positive or negative.  
5. Write a function that takes a number and returns its square.  
6. Write a function that takes a string and prints it in uppercase.  
7. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their product.  
8. Define a function that takes two arguments and returns the larger of the two numbers.  
9. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum.  
10. Define a function that takes a name and age as parameters and prints a message introducing the person.  
11. Write a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
12. Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in it.  
13. Write a function that takes a number and returns its factorial.

17. Write a function to take three numbers and return the average.  
18. Write a function that returns the maximum of three numbers.  
19. Write a function that takes two strings as arguments and concatenates them.  
20. Write a function that returns the product of a list of numbers.  
21. Define a function that accepts a string and returns the number of words in it.  
22. Write a function that checks whether a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.  
23. Write a function to return the square root of a number.  
24. Write a function that checks if a number is prime.  
25. Define a function that returns the smallest of three numbers.  
26. Write a function that takes two integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD).  
27. Define a function that takes a string and returns whether it is a palindrome.  
28. Write a function that returns the count of uppercase and lowercase letters in a string.  
29. Define a function that takes a list and returns the largest element.  
30. Write a function that takes a string and counts how many times a particular character appears in it.

### Keyword Arguments

31. Write a function that takes a personâ€™s name and age as keyword arguments and prints a message introducing the person.  
32. Define a function that takes a radius as a positional argument and a unit of measurement (defaulting to "meters") as a keyword argument.  
33. Write a function to calculate the area of a rectangle with length and width as positional arguments, and unit as a keyword argument.  
34. Write a function that calculates the distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using keyword arguments for the coordinates.  
35. Write a function that takes a name, age, and country as keyword arguments and prints them in a formatted sentence.

## Advanced Level (36â€“50): Default Arguments, Variable Arguments, Recursion

### Default Arguments and Variable Arguments

36. Write a function that calculates the power of a number, with the exponent defaulting to 2.  
37. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their average, with a default of an empty list if no argument is passed.  
38. Write a function that accepts any number of arguments and returns their sum.  
39. Define a function that accepts a variable number of arguments and prints each one on a new line.  
40. Write a function that accepts multiple strings and returns them concatenated together.  
41. Define a function that accepts multiple keyword arguments and prints the key-value pairs.  
42. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list containing the square of each number.  
43. Write a function that finds the longest string in a list of strings.  
44. Define a function that accepts a list and returns the second largest element.  
45. Write a function that accepts both positional and keyword arguments and returns a dictionary with both.

### Recursion

46. Write a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number.  
47. Write a recursive function to find the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.  
48. Write a recursive function that computes the sum of digits of a number.  
49. Write a recursive function to reverse a string.  
50. Write a recursive function that prints numbers from 1 to N.
